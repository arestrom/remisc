# remisc

## Overview

This package is a collection of very simple utility functions for my own use. I created this
package in part just to learn how to build a package. I also built it to avoid having to 
source or paste in functions I use reasonably often, but keep forgetting the exact code to 
recreate.

Most of these were cribbed from elsewhere, including from *Advanced R, Wickham (2014)*, and
*R Project* documentation. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arestrom/remisc")
```
