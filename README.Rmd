# remisc

## Overview

This package started as a collection of some very simple utility functions for
my own use. I created this package in part just to learn how to build a package.
I also built it to avoid having to source or paste in functions I use reasonably
often, but keep forgetting how to recreate.

Most of the functions in this package were cribbed, or adapted, from the work
of others, including from *Advanced R, Wickham (2014)*, stackoverflow questions, 
the dplR package (get_uuid()) and the *R Project* documentation.

## Installation

Requires R-3.5.0 or higher

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arestrom/remisc")
```
