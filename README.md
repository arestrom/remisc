remisc
======

Overview
--------

This package started as a collection of some very simple utility functions for my own use. I created this package in part just to learn how to build a package. I also built it to avoid having to source or paste in functions I use reasonably often, but keep forgetting how to recreate.

Most of the functions in this package were cribbed, or adapted, from the work of others, including from *Advanced R, Wickham (2014)*, stackoverflow questions, the uuid package by Simon Urbanek, and the *R Project* documentation.

Installation
------------

Requires R-3.6.0 or higher

``` r
# Install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arestrom/remisc")
```
